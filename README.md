## Project Overview
This project analyzes accident data to uncover insights related to road surface types, weather conditions, light conditions, and the causes of accidents. The analysis aims to identify patterns that can inform safety measures and policy decisions.

## Features
- Data exploration and preprocessing of accident records
- Visualizations of accident distributions by:
  - Road surface type
  - Weather conditions
  - Light conditions (time of day)
  - Top causes of accidents
- Analysis of accident severity in relation to light conditions
- Correlation heatmap for numeric features

## Technologies
- **Python 3**
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas (Data manipulation)
  - Matplotlib (Visualization)
  - Seaborn (Enhanced visualizations)

## Dataset
- **Source**: Cleaned Accident Data
- **Contents**: Accident records including:
  - Road surface type, weather conditions, light conditions
  - Cause of accident, accident severity
